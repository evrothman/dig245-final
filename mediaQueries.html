  <p> Media queries allow you to change the visuals of your webpage based on a
    variety of factors, most importantly the height and width of the webpage.
    Though sometimes this can be achived using <a href =""> view height and view width</a>
    more often you will need to use media queries. For example, if you want your
    webpage to accomodate smaller devices better or to accomodate for light and
    dark modes. </p>
    <br>
  <p> One easy way to accomplish some of these goals is by incorporating a css
    framework into your webpage. A great option for this is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/"> bootstrap</a>.
    bootstrap is a css framework that has created different class names with
    predefined commands. For example, it can change the amount of horizonal space
    a block of html takes up based on the width of the screen your user has.</p>
    <br>
  <p> However, a framework like bootstrap isn't all encompassing. If you want to
    make more complex changes to your website under certain conditions, understanding
    how media queries work can be invaluable.</p>
