<h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class ="container body">

      <p> Selectors are elements that allows you to change the appearance of a
        specific piece of your html. There are several different types of selectors.
        The first of these we'll call html selectors, which are the tags used to
        build the page. Next are classes & ids, which the user can assign to
        parts of the html code. The third is interactive selectors, also called
        psuedo classes. These change according to how the user has interacted with
        your page. You can also use any combination of these to be even more
        specific in where to apply these changes.<p>
    <br>
    <h2> HTML Selectors </h2>
    <p> As mention above, you can change the visual element of your page by
      identifying element by their html tags. On this page, we could use this to
      change the color of the paragraphs using the &lt;p&gt; tag. That would look
      something like this on your stylesheet: </p>
      <h5><pre>
     p{
        text-align: center;
        font-color: black;
      }
    </pre></h5>
    <p> These tags are helpful when your doing general page formatting, such as
      what we've done here. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Classes & Ids </h2>
    <p> Classes and Ids are very similar, in that they are classification that the
      writer of the code gives to chunks of code. Classes are more general purpose,
      as they can be assigned to as many different elements in a page. They are also
      useful in that they overrule html level selectors. If you have a specific
      paragraph that you'd like to have red text instead of black, then using
      a class may be your best choice. When styling based on class, you should use
      a period prior to the class name. In your stylesheet, this will look like
      the following: </p>
      <h5><pre>
        .className{
          color:red;
        }
      </pre></h5>
    <p> What seperates classes and Ids is that an Id is a more specific selector.
      Unlike a class, Ids can only be used once per page, and overrule html selectors
      as well as classes.Generally, it is best to avoid Ids unless you have a
      very specific purpose. We use a pound sign/hashtag to style an Id. In your
      style sheet, this will look like:</p>
      <h5><pre>
        #idName{
          color:red;
        }
      </pre></h5>
</div>
